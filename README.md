Welcome on this github for my L3 Stage.

# Codes
Contains all the code I have written for my stage.

The code in `MAD_src` is not my work, it is from Fran√ßois Painblanc.

All the test_<method>.py could have been generalize to one python script, asking the good parameters.
But I did not know how to give parameters throught .sh file. 
So I did it like that.
